# Pacmen
Pacmen Project

#ABOUT

  This project was created using MIT license, and is a JS DOM browser program. Pacmen are forced into an array with random locations, velocities, and trajectories. A color flipper
  HEX generator has been added to improve UX and aesthetics. CSS styling has been added to buttons with hover effects.
  
#DEPLOYMENT

  Load the file into your browser, or visit my portfolio page, https://willh87.github.io and click "Make Pacmen" button to begin manufacturing Pacmen. You can always add more
  dynamically after clicking "Start". The Color Flipper button will produce random colors infinitely with every click. Home button will return you to willh87.github.io.
  
 #IMPROVEMENTS
 
  It is a future effort to dynamically add in more animation for the Pacmen with several images loaded in the Repo to add a "chomping" effect. More ideas to consider are changing
  velocities on "check boundaries", or changing sizes of the pacemen dynamically.
